# 🚀 Email Unsubscribe Magic ✨

Hey there! Welcome to the ultimate tool in your digital arsenal against those pesky spam attacks - your very own Email Unsubscribe Wizard 🧙‍♂️! This Jupyter Notebook is more than just a bunch of code; it's your ticket to a cleaner, more serene inbox 📥.

Tired of endless spam emails clogging up your digital world? Annoyed by subscriptions you don't remember signing up for? We've got you covered! This tool dives into the abyss of your Spam folder and emerges with all those hidden unsubscribe links. It's like a treasure hunt, but instead of gold, you're finding peace of mind 🏝️.

This Python notebook processes emails from a specified `.mbox` file (particularly the Spam folder from a Gmail Takeout export) and sends unsubscribe requests to unique links found in these emails. It only processes emails sent within a specified number of days (default is the last 10 days)

## Project Structure

Your folder should be structured as follows:

```
❯ tree
.
├── README.md
├── Takeout
│   ├── Mail
│   │   └── Spam.mbox
│   └── archive_browser.html
├── takeout-20231206T082003Z-001.zip
└── unsub.py

```

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install notebook requests tqdm ipywidgets
```

## Usage

1. **Set Up Your `.mbox` File**: Place your `.mbox` file in the correct directory (`Takeout/Mail/Spam.mbox`).

2. **Configure the Notebook**: Edit the `mbox_path` variable in the notebook to point to your `.mbox` file. If you want to process emails from a different time range, modify the `days` variable (set to `None` to process all emails).

3. **Run the notebook**: Open the notebook using Python.

```bash
jupyter notebook unsub.ipynb
```

   - Run each cell in the Jupyter Notebook sequentially.
   - You can execute the cells by selecting each and pressing `Shift + Enter`, or by using the 'Run' button in your Jupyter interface.

## Notebook Overview

- `find_unsubscribe_links`: This function extracts unsubscribe links from the email content. It searches for URLs that contain the word 'unsubscribe'.

- `send_unsubscribe_request`: This function sends an HTTP GET request to each unsubscribe link. It includes a custom Firefox user-agent in the request header.

- `is_recent`: This function determines if an email is within the specified date range. It's used to filter emails by date, processing only those that were sent within the last `days` (default is 10).

- Main loop: The script iterates through the `.mbox` file, processing only recent emails based on the `days` parameter. For each email, it extracts and collects unsubscribe links, avoiding duplicates. It then uses a thread pool to send unsubscribe requests concurrently to each unique link.
